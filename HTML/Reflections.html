	<p style = "color: #ffff00">Community norms are what most people in a community believe to be morally correct. The community norms at the hidden genius project seem to be fairly bacic. We do what is considered “good” by most people conforming to rules such as avoiding cursing and violence. I say considered good because community norms can be different depending on ones’ location. Community norms in Richmond California could differ greatly from what is considered normal in a different state or country.</p>

	<p style = "color: #ffff00">Marcus Garvey was a lot of things including an entrepreneur, journalist and publisher. He was primarily, however, an activist for unity in the black community. One of his most famous quotes (shown above) means that one cannot succeed unless they acknowledge those that came before them.

</h2>

	<img src="../img-folder/img/06-20-18.png" width = "200" height="200">
	<p style = "color: #ffff00">The message of this quote is that though you may be able to go fast without the apparent drawback of others, they are necessary if you want to get far in life. There was also an account about an anthropologist and his study. He went to an african tribe and told the children that the first to a basket he had hidden under a tree would get to eat all the fruit inside. When it was time for the kids to start, they took each others hands and reached the fruit together following the principle of Ubuntu.

	<h2 style="color: #ffff00">Today, we learned of the importance of brotherhood, unity, working together and solving problems together. After learning about the african children's way of solving their problem, we were asked to imitate their teamwork by untying ourselves from a knot. We did and learned a little more about cooperation.

</h2>

	<img src="../img-folder/img/06-26-18.png" width = "200" height="200">
	<p style = "color: #ffff00"> This quote means that no matter how strong your group is, you will be powerless without a strong leader. Because sheep are naturally followers, they would make an excellent army but shouldn't be leaders.

	<p style = "color: #ffff00"> This means that no matter what you look like or what you think of people, you cannot survive without the help and support of others. You should not be so petty that you refuse teamwork because that would make you a fool.

</h2>
	<h2 style="color: #ffff00">If you make a man feel that he is inferior, you do not have to compel him to accept an inferior status, for he will seek it himself. If you make a man think that he is justly an outcast, you do not have to order him to the back door. He will go without being told, and if there is no back door, his very nature will demand one. --Carter G. Woodson T

	<p style = "color: #ffff00"> This means that if your state of mind reaches a certain low, you will feel you are inferior. Once you have these feelings of insuperiority, those treating you wrong won't even have to work to demoralize you.

	<h2 style="color: #ffff00">Social Construct is an idea or notion that appears to be natural and obvious to people who accept it but may or may not represent reality, so it remains largely an invention or artifice of a given society.

</h2>
	<h2 style="color: #ffff00"> “I prefer to be true to myself, even at the hazard of incurring the ridicule of others, rather than to be false, and to incur my own abhorrence.” ― Frederick Douglass.




</h2>

	<img src="../img-folder/img/07-02-18.png" width = "200" height="200">
	<p style = "color: #ffff00"> Frederick Douglass is saying  that even if he is reprimanded by other people, he will stick to his ideals because it is better than the shame that lying to himself will bring.

	<h2 style="color: #ffff00">How to respect yourself </h2>

	<h2 style="color: #ffff00">Respecting yourself mainly consists of keeping a positive attitude. It is very important to keep a positive mindset because if you do, you will be able to surpass expectations.

	<h2 style="color: #ffff00"> We are going to emancipate yourselves from mental slavery because whilst others might free the body none but ourselves can free the mind. -Marcus Garvey

If you have no confidence in self, you are twice defeated in the race of life. -Marcus Garvey





</h2>

	<img src="../img-folder/img/07-03-18.png" width = "200" height="200">
	<p style = "color: #ffff00"> These two quotes are very similar and both send a powerful message. In the first one, Garvey is saying that you cannot be truly free unless you achieve the correct frame of mind. If you are able to free your mind, not even cages can contain you. Similarly, the second quote is saying that if you lose confidence, you will fail both mentally and physically.

	<h2 style="color: #ffff00">How to respect yourself 2</h2>
	<img src="../img-folder/img/Topic_07-03-18.png" width = "200" height="200">
	<h2 style="color: #ffff00">Slave masters completely demoralized african americans in an effort to make them believe that they were nothing. Once that mindset was planted, african american people ended up passing that way of thinking to their children.
